// Farmer and His Sons

// A farmer wants to divide his 17 horses among his three sons. According to farmer the oldest son should get 
// half of the horses,the middle son should get one third of the horses and the youngest son should get one 
// ninth of the horses. When their father died they were not able to divide the horses as the result was coming 
// in fractions. As the sons were fighting on how to divide the horses a traveling mathematician came and heard 
// their problem. He proposed a solution with which all the sons got their share in the property without harming any animal.
// What was the advice given and how the group of horses were divided?


//                                              Solution:

// Well, this puzzle is interesting. you have to think such that with the solution everybody is happy and no body will suffer a loss.

// Let’s see the problem first.
// we have 17 horses to be divided among three sons with the ratio as given.

// 1st son — half of the horses (17/2)=8.5
// 2nd son — one third of horses (17/3)=5.66
// 3rd son — one ninth of horses (17/9)=1.88

// Now all the results are in fraction so the horses cannot be distributed like this. What will the traveling mathematician do to solve it.

// It’s simple. He will add his horse to the group of horses. So in total we have 18 horses now. Now let’s see the scenario again.

// 1st son — half of the horses (18/2)=9
// 2nd son — one third of horses (18/3)=6
// 3rd son — one ninth of horses (18/9)=2

// So in total 17 horses will get distributed among the three sons and the traveling mathematician will take his horse and leave.
