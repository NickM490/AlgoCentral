// The Three Light Bulbs



// A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing an identical light bulb or light globe. 
// Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched off at present. 
// You are outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the light switches
//  as many times as you like. But once you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. After this, you go into 
//  the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?

// Switch on switches 1 & 2, wait a moment and switch off number 2.
// Enter the room. Whichever bulb is on is wired to switch 1, whichever
//  is off and hot is wired to switch number 2, and the third is wired to switch 3.
