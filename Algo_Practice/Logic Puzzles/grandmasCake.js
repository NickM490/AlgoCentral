// Grandma's Cake

// You are on your way to visit your Grandma, who lives at the end of the valley. It’s her anniversary,
//  and you want to give her the cakes you’ve made. Between your house and her house, you have to cross
//   5 bridges, and as it goes in the land of make believe, there is a troll under every bridge! Each troll, 
//   quite rightly, insists that you pay a troll toll. Before you can cross their bridge, you have to give
//    them half of the cakes you are carrying, but as they are kind trolls, they each give you back a single cake.

// How many cakes do you have to leave home with to make sure that you arrive at Grandma’s with exactly 2 cakes?

//                                          Solution:
//                                           2 Cakes

// At each bridge you are required to give half of your cakes, and you receive one back. Which leaves you with 2 cakes after every bridge.
